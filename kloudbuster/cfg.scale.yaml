# KloudBuster Default configuration file

# This file can be copied, used as a template to specify different settings, then
# passed to KloudBuster using the '--config-file <path> option.
# In the copy, properties that are unchanged (use same as default) can be simply removed
# from the file.

# Config options common to client and server side

# Name of the image to use for all test VMs (client, server and proxy)
# The image name must exist in OpenStack and must be built with the appropriate
# packages.
# The default test VM image is named "kloudbuster_v<version>" where
# <version> is the KloudBuster test VM image version (e.g. "kloudbuster_v3")
# Leave empty to use the default test VM image (recommended).
# If non empty use quotes if there are space characters in the name (e.g. 'my image')

# Keystone admin role name (default should work in most deployments)

# Cleanup all kloudbuster resources upon exit
# If set to False, resources created will not be deleted on exit and the user
# will have to execute the cleanup script later to remove all these resources
cleanup_resources: True

# VM creation concurrency
# Specifies how many VMs will be created at a time. Larger numbers can be used
# but will not necessarily shorten the overall staging time (this will largely
# depend on the scalability of the OpenStack control plane).
# Well tuned control planes with multiple instances of Nova have shown to support
# a concurrency level of up to around 50
vm_creation_concurrency: 5

# Public key to use to access all test VMs
# ssh access to the test VMs launched by kloudbuster is not required
# but can be handy if the user wants to ssh manually to any of them (for example
# to debug)
#
# If empty will default to the user's public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) if it
# exists, otherwise will not provision any public key.
# If configured or available, a key pair will be added for each
# configured user.
