# KloudBuster Default configuration file

# Name of the image to use for all test VMs (client, server and proxy)
# The image name must exist in OpenStack and must be built with the appropriate
# packages.
# The default test VM image is named "kloudbuster_<version>" where
# <version> is the KloudBuster test VM image version (e.g. "kloudbuster_v3")
# Leave empty to use the default test VM image (recommended).
# If non empty use quotes if there are space characters in the name (e.g. 'my image')

# if empty will default to the user's public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) if it
# exists, otherwise will not provision any public key.
# If configured or available, a key pair will be added for each
# configured user.
