Overview

How good is your OpenStack data plane under real heavy load?

KloudBuster is a tool that can load the data plane of any Neutron OpenStack
cloud at massive scale and can measure how well the cloud behaves under load.

Features
--------

* Neutron configuration agnostic (any encapsulation, any overlay, any plugin )

* Can load the data plane with one OpenStack cloud (single-cloud operations
  for L3 East-West scale) or 2 OpenStack clouds (dual-cloud operations with
  one cloud hosting the HTTP servers and the other loading HTTP traffic for
  L3 North-South scale testing)

* User can specify any number of tenants, routers, networks (only limited by
  cloud capacity) and KloudBuster will stage all these resources in a way that
  makes sense for operational data plane traffic

* HTTP traffic load:

   * Real HTTP servers (Nginx) running in real Linux images (Ubuntu 14.04)

   * Can specify any number of HTTP servers per tenant

   * High performance and highly scalable HTTP traffic generators to simulate
     huge number of HTTP users and TCP connections (hundreds of thousands
     to millions)

   * overall throughput and latency measurement for every single HTTP request
     (typically millions per run) using the open source HdrHistogram library

* Traffic shaping to specify on which links traffic should flow

* Highly efficient and scalable metric aggregation

* Can support periodic reporting and aggregation of results

* Automatic cleanup upon termination (by default)

* Manual cleanup script

* Web Server mode with Web UI to drive scale test from your browser
 
* Web Server mode with REST interface:

   * Allows KloudBuster to be driven by other programs
   * Swagger 2.0 YAML description of the REST interface

* Aggregated results provide an easy to understand way to assess the scale
  of the cloud under test

* KloudBuster VM images built using OpenStack DIB (Disk Image Builder)

* Verified to work on any OpenStack release starting from IceHouse


Limitations
-----------

* Requires Neutron networking (does not support Nova networking)
* Only supports HTTP traffic in this version


Contributions and Feedbacks
---------------------------

If you are interested in OpenStack Performance and Scale, contributions and
feedbacks are welcome!

The KloudBuster code is still relatively small in size and touches many
different areas such as:

* Backend control plane and data plane (python, C)
* Frontend RESTful interface
* REST modeilizatiuon (swagger)
* Web User Interface (javascript)

If you have any feedbacks or would like to make small or large contributions,
simply send an email to openstack-dev@lists.openstack.org with a
'[kloudbuster]' tag in the subject.
