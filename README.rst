How good is your OpenStack data or storage plane under real heavy load?

KloudBuster is a tool that can load the data or storage plane of any OpenStack
cloud at massive scale and can measure how well the cloud behaves under load.

Anybody with very basic knowledge of OpenStack, data plane and storage performance concepts can use the tool and get scale numbers for any OpenStack cloud straight off the box wth pre-defined default workloads.


Features
--------

* Neutron configuration agnostic (any encapsulation, any overlay, any plugin)

* OpenStack Storage backend agnostic

* User can specify any number of tenants, routers, networks, VM instances (only limited by
  cloud capacity) and KloudBuster will stage all these resources in a way that
  makes sense for operational usage

* Real VM-level performance and scale numbers (not bare metal)

* Punishing scale (thousands of VMs and enough load to fill even the fastest NIC cards or load any storage cluster with ease - if your cloud can even support that much)

* Data plane with HTTP traffic load:

   * Can load the data plane with one OpenStack cloud (single-cloud operations
     for L3 East-West scale) or 2 OpenStack clouds (dual-cloud operations with
     one cloud hosting the HTTP servers and the other loading HTTP traffic for
     L3 North-South scale testing)

   * Real HTTP servers (Nginx) running in real Linux images (Ubuntu 14.04)

   * Can specify any number of HTTP servers per tenant (as many as your cloud can handle)

   * High performance and highly scalable HTTP traffic generators to simulate
     huge number of HTTP users and TCP connections (hundreds of thousands
     to millions of concurrent and active connections)

   * overall throughput aggegation and loss-less latency aggregation for every single HTTP request
     (typically millions per run) using the open source HdrHistogram library

   * Traffic shaping to specify on which links traffic should flow

   * Can support periodic reporting and aggregation of results

* Storage load:

   * VM-level Cinder volume file I/O using FIO running inside VMs (not bare metal)

   * Supports random amd sequential file access mode

   * Supports read, write and read/write mix

   * IOPs, bandwitdh and loss-less latency aggregation

   * User configurable storage workload profiles

* Supports automated scale progressions (VM count series in any multiple increment)

* Highly efficient and scalable metric aggregation

* Automatic cleanup upon termination (can be disabled)

* Manual cleanup script

* KloudBuster Web Server with Web UI to drive scale test from your browser
 
* KloudBuster REST Server allows external programs to drive scale automation using REST

* Aggregated results provide an easy to understand way to assess the scale
  of the cloud under test

* KloudBuster VM image pre-built and available from the OpenStack Community App Catalog (https://apps.openstack.org/)


Limitations
-----------

* Requires Neutron networking (does not support Nova networking)
* Only supports HTTP and storage traffic in this version
