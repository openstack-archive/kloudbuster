=====
Usage
=====

There are three ways for running KloudBuster, the easiest being the **Web UI**.
It offers the most user friendly interface and needs the least learning to get
started. **CLI** is the traditional way to run applications. It has the most
comprehensive feature sets when compared to the other two ways. **Rest API**
gives another way to access and control KloudBuster from another application.
The built-in Web UI is fully implemented on top of the REST API.

The default scale settings of KloudBuster is at minimal scale, which is
generally safe to run on any cloud, small or large. It should also work on an
all-in-one devstack cloud installation as well. The minimal pre-requisites to
run KloudBuster:

    * Admin access to the cloud under test (non-admin might work with some
      tweaks and limitations)
    * 3 available floating IPs if running HTTP data plane testing, 2 available
      floating IPs if running Storage testing

Regardless of the way you launch KloudBuster, you will need the access info and
the credentials to the cloud under test.  This information can be downloaded
from a Horizon dashboard (Project|Access&Security|Api Access|Download OpenStack
RC File). Save it to your local filesystem for future use.


Running KloudBuster as a Web/REST Server
----------------------------------------

Starting the KloudBuster Server from a VM Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to use KloudBuster is to run it as a web server application
running in a VM. The pre-built KloudBuster qcow2 image contains the Web server
and is ready to service HTTP and REST requests once up and running. To get the
KloudBuster Web server running in any OpenStack cloud:

1. Follow the steps :ref:`here <upload_kb_image>` to upload the KloudBuster
   image to the openstack cloud that will host your KloudBuster web server

.. note::
   This could be the same as the cloud under test or a different cloud.

2. If necessary, and as for any VM-based web server application bringup, create
   and configure the Neutron router and network where the KloudBuster web server
   VM instance will be attached

3. Create or reuse a security group which allows ingress TCP traffic on port
   8080

4. Launch an instance using the KloudBuster imageï¼Œwith the proper security
   group, and connect to the appropriate network. Leave the Key Pair as blank,
   as we don't need the SSH access to this VM

5. Associate a floating IP to the newly created VM instance so that it can be
   accessible from an external browser

The base URL to use for REST access is::

    http://<floating_ip>:8080

The Web UI URL to use from any browser is::

    http://<floating_ip>:8080/ui/index.html


Starting the KloudBuster Server from PyPI installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the virtual environment which hosts KloudBuster, run::

    $ kb_start_server

You should see a message similar to the one below, which indicates the server
is up running::

    Starting server in PID 27873
    serving on 0.0.0.0:8080, view at http://127.0.0.1:8080


Starting the KloudBuster Server from a git clone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use git clone, you can bring up the KloudBuster Web/REST server fron the
CLI.  KloudBuster uses the `Pecan <http://www.pecanpy.org/>`_ web server to host
both the KloudBuster REST server and the KloudBuster front-end website (which
listens to port 8080 by default).

From the root of the KloudBuster repository, go to the kb_server directory. If
this is the first time to start the server, run below command once to setup the
environment::

    $ python setup.py develop

Then start the server by doing::

    $ pecan serve config.py

You should see a message similar to the one below, which indicates the server
is up running::

    Starting server in PID 26431
    serving on 0.0.0.0:8080, view at http://127.0.0.1:8080


Using the KloudBuster Web UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using any browser, point to the provided URL at port 8080. You will get a Login
page where you will need to enter:

   * The type of scale test (HTTP data plane or storage)
   * The location of openrc file of the cloud under test
   * The credentials for the cloud under test


Interacting with the KloudBuster Server REST Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the server is started, you can use different HTTP methods
(GET/PUT/POST/DELETE) to interact with the KloudBuster REST interface using the
provided URL at port 8080.

    * `KloudBuster REST API Documentation Preview <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/openstack/kloudbuster/blob/master/doc/source/_static/kloudbuster-swagger.html>`_
    * `REST API Documentation (Swagger yaml) <https://github.com/openstack/kloudbuster/blob/master/kb_server/kloudbuster-swagger.yaml>`_


Running the KloudBuster from CLI
--------------------------------

If you do not really need a Web UI or REST interface, you can simply run
KloudBuster scale test straight from CLI.

KloudBuster is ready to run with the default configuration, which can be
displayed from the command line using *--show-config* option. By default,
KloudBuster will run on a single cloud and run the default HTTP data plane scale
test:

    * Create 2 tenants, 2 users, and 2 routers;
    * Create 1 shared network for both servers and clients tenants
    * Create 1 VM running as an HTTP server
    * Create 1 VM running the Redis server (for orchestration)
    * Create 1 VM running the HTTP traffic generator (default to 1000 connections,
      1000 requests per second, and 30 seconds duration
    * Measure/aggegate throughput and latency
    * Bring down and cleanup

Run KloudBuster with the following options::

    kloudbuster --tested-rc <path_to_the_admin_rc_file> --tested-passwd <admin_password>

.. note::

    Simply adding *--storage* to the above command will run KloudBuster with
    storage testing.

The run should take couple of minutes (depending on how fast the cloud can
create the resources) and you should see the actions taken by KloudBuster
displayed on the console. Once this minimal scale test passes, you can tackle
more elaborate scale testing by increasing the scale numbers or providing
various traffic shaping options. See below sections for more details about
configuring KloudBuster.


KloudBuster Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a custom scale test configuration, make a copy of the default
configuration and modify that file to satisfy our own needs. A copy of the
default configuration can be obtained by redirecting the output of
*--show-config* to a new file.  Once done, provide that custom configuration
file to the KloudBuster command line using the *--config <file>* option.

.. note::

    Note that the default configuration is always loaded by KloudBuster and
    any default option can be overridden by providing a custom configuration
    file that only contains modified options. So you can delete all the lines
    in the configuration file that you do not intend to change


General Options
"""""""""""""""

Each item in cfg.scale.yaml is well documented and self-explained. Below is
just a quick-start on some important config items that need to be paid more
attention.

* **vm_creation_concurrency**

This controls the level of concurrency when creating VMs. There is no
recommended values, as it really varies and up to the cloud performance.
On a well-deployed cloud, you may able to push the values to more than 50.
Safely to say, 5 would be OK for most deployments.

.. note::

    For deployment prior to Kilo release, you may hit this
    `bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1194579>`_ if the
    concurrency level is too high. Try to lower down the value if
    you are hitting this issue.

* **server:number_tenants, server:routers_per_tenant,
  server:networks_per_router, server:vms_per_network**

These are the four key values which controls the scale of the cloud you are
going to create. Depends on how you want the VM to be created, sets these values
differently. For example, if we want to create 180 Server VMs, we could do
either of the following settings:

(1) 30 tenants, 1 router per tenant, 2 networks per router, and 3 VMs per
network (so-called 30*1*2*3);

(2) 20 tenants, 3 routers per tenant, 3 networks per router, and 1 VMs per
network (so-called 20*3*3*1);

* **server:secgroups_per_network**

Reference Neutron router implementation is using IPTABLES to perform
security controls, which should be OK for small scale networks. This
setting for now is to investigate the upper limit capacity that Neutron
can handle. Keep the default to 1 if you don't have the concerns on
this part yet.

* **client:progression**

KloudBuster will give multiple runs (progression) on the cloud under this mode.

If enabled, KloudBuster will start with certain amount of VMs, and put more VMs
into the testing for every iteration. The increment of the VM count is specified
by *vm_multiple*. The iteration will continue until it reaches the scale defined
in the upper sections, or the stop limit.

The stop limit is used for KloudBuster to determine when to stop the
progression, and do the cleanup if needed earlier.

In the case of HTTP testing:

    It is defines as: [number_of_err_packets,
    percentile_of_packet_not_timeout(%)]. For example: [50, 99.99] means,
    KloudBuster will continue the progression run only if **ALL** below
    conditions are satisfied:

    (1) The error count of packets are less or equal than 50;

    (2) 99.99% of the packets are within the timeout range;

In the case of Storage testing:

    It is a single integer indicating the degrading percentile. In the mode of
    random read and random write, this value indicates the percentile of
    degrading on IOPS, while in the mode of sequential read and sequential
    write, this value indicates the percentile of degrading on throughput.

    Assume the IOPS or throughput per VM is a fixed value, usually we are
    expecting higher values when the VM count grows. At certain point where the
    capacity of storage is reached, the overall performance will start to
    degrade.

    e.g. In the randread and randwrite mode, for example the IOPS is limited to
    100 IOPS/VM. In the iteration of 10 VMs, the requested IOPS for the system
    is 100 * 10 = 1000. However, the measured IOPS is degraded to only 800 IOPS.
    So the degraded percentile is calculated as 800/1000=20% for this set of
    data.


HTTP Tool Specific Options
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* **client:http_tool_configs**

This section controls how the HTTP traffic will be generated. Below are the two
values which determine the traffic::

    # Connections to be kept concurrently per VM
    connections: 1000
    # Rate limit in RPS per client (0 for unlimited)
    rate_limit: 1000

Each testing VM will have its targeting HTTP server for sending the requests.
Simply to say, connections determines the how many concurrent users that the
tool is emulating, and rate_limit determines how fast the HTTP request will be
sent. If the connections are more than the capacity of the cloud can handle,
socket errors or timeouts will occur; if the requests are sending too fast, you
will likely to have lots of requests responded very slow (will be reflected in
the latency distribution spectrum generated by KloudBuster).

Different cloud has different capacity to handle data plane traffics.  The best
practice is to have an estimate first, and get started.  In a typical 10GE VLAN
deployment, the line rate is about 9Gbps, or 1.125 GB/s. For pure HTTP traffic,
the effective rate minus the overhead is approximately 80% of the line rate,
which is about 920 MB/s. Each HTTP request will consume 32KB traffic for loading
the HTML page (HTML payload size is configurable), so the cloud capacity is
about 30,000 req/sec.  If you are staging a cloud with 20 testing pairs, the
rate_limit for each VM settings will be about (30000 / 20 = 1500).

The capacity for handling connections varies among factors including kernel
tuning, server software, server configs, etc. and hard to have an estimate. It
is simple to start with the same count as the rate_limit to have (1
request/connection) for each VM, and we can adjust it later to find out the
maximum value. If you see socket errors or timeouts, means the scale you are
testing is more than the cloud capacity.

Some other values which are self-explained, and you can change them as needed.


Storage Tool Specific Options
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* **client:storage_tool_configs**

This section controls how the Storage tests will be performed. All the fields
are self-explained, and you can create your own test case with customized
parameters.

* **client:storage_target**

KloudBuster supports to test the storage performance on Cinder volumes or
ephemeral disks. Specify the testing target here.

* **client:disk_size**

This controls the size of the Cinder volume or ephemeral disk to be attached to
each VM instance. (in GB)

* **client:io_file_size**

This controls the size of the test file to be used for storage testing. (in GB)


Advanced Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Control the VM Placement
""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, VMs are placed by NOVA using its own scheduling logic. However,
traffic can be shaped precisely to fill the appropriate network links by using
specific configuration settings. KloudBuster can change that behavior, and
force NOVA to place VMs on desired hypervisors as we defined by supplying
the topology file.

The format of the topology file is relatively simple, and group into two
sections. See file "cfg.topo.yaml" for an example.

The "servers_rack" section contains the hypervisors that the server side VMs
will be spawned on, and the "clients_rack" section contains the hypervisors
that the client side VMs will be spawned on. The hypervisor names can be
obtained from Horizon dashboard, or via "*nova hypervisor-list*". Note that
the name in the config files must exactly match the name shown in Horizon
dashboard or NOVA API output.

A typical use case is to place all server VMs on one rack, and all client VMs
on the other rack to test Rack-to-Rack performance. Similarly, all server VMs
on one host, and all client VMs on the other host to test the Host-to-Host
performance.

To use this feature, just pass *-t <path_to_topo_file>* to the kloudbuster
command line.

.. note:: Admin access is required to use this feature.


Running KloudBuster without admin access
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When there is no admin access to the cloud under test, KloudBuster does
support to run and reused the existing tenant and user for running tests.
You have to ask the cloud admin one time to create the resources in advance,
and KloudBuster will create the resources using the pre-created tenant/user.

When running under the tenant/user reusing mode:

    * Only one tenant will be used for hosting both server cloud and client
      cloud resources;
    * Only two users will be used for creating resources, and each cloud has
      its own user;

And also there are some limitations that you should aware:

    * The VM placement feature will not be supported;
    * The flavor configs will be ignored, and the KloudBuster will
      automatically pick the closest flavor settings from the existing list;
    * KloudBuster will not automatically adjust the tenant quota, and give
      warnings when quota exceeded;

See file "cfg.tenants.yaml" for an example. Modify the settings to match your
cloud.

To use this feature, just pass *-l <path_to_tenants_file>* to the kloudbuster
command line.


Displaying the Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Results can be saved in a file in json format or in html format. The json format
is more appropriate for usage by any post-processing tool or script while the
html file is more adapted for human usage.

The KloudBuster Web UI will display the results using charts and tables when the
test is finished running.  The KloudBuster CLI provides an option to generate
the html file from the results (*--html* option).  It can also generate the html
file from the json results (*--charts-from-json* option).


Examples of running KloudBuster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming the OpenStack RC file is stored at ~/admin_openrc.sh, and the
password is "admin". Running the program is relatively easy, some examples
are given to help get started quickly.

.. note::

    Before going to large scale test, it is strongly recommended to start with
    a small scale. The default config is a good point to start with. It will
    make sure KloudBuster is talking to the clouds well.


Example 1: Single-cloud Mode
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Kloudbuster will create both server VMs and client VMs in the same cloud if
only one RC file is provided::

    $ kloudbuster --tested-rc ~/admin_openrc.sh --tested-passwd admin


Example 2: Dual-cloud Mode, Save results
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Assume the cloud for server VMs is ~/admin_openrc1.sh, and the cloud for
client VMs is ~/admin_openrc2.sh. The password for both clouds is "admin".
Also save the results to a JSON file once the run is finished::

    $ kloudbuster --tested-rc ~/admin_openrc1.sh --tested-passwd admin --testing-rc ~/admin_openrc2.sh --testing-passwd admin --json result.json


Example 3: Single-cloud Mode, Customized VM placements
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code::

    $ kloudbuster --tested-rc ~/admin_openrc.sh --tested-passwd admin -t cfg.topo.yaml


Example 4: Single-cloud Mode, Running storage test, Save results to JSON
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code::

    $ kloudbuster --tested-rc ~/aio-openrc.sh --tested-passwd lab --storage --json aio.json


KloudBuster Standard Scale Profile
----------------------------------

Multiple factors can impact data plane scale numbers measured by KloudBuster: VM
count, number of connections per VM, number of requests per seconds per VM,
timeout, etc...  To help obtaining quick and easy results without having to
tweak too many parameters, KloudBuster defines an off the shelf *default scale
profile*.

In the default scale profile for running HTTP load:

- The number of connections per VM is set to 1000;
- The number of requests per seconds per VM is set to 1000;
- The HTTP request timeout is set to 5 seconds;
- The stop limit for progression runs will be error packets greater than 50;
- The size of the HTML page in the server VMs will be 32768 Bytes;

As a reference, KloudBuster can run approximately 21 VMs (with 21,000
connections and 21,000 HTTP requests/sec) and achieve approximately 5 Gbps of
HTTP throughput on a typical multi-node Kilo OpenStack deployment (LinuxBridge +
VLAN, 10GE NIC card).

In the default scale profile for running Storage load:

- A standard set of 6 test cases (random read/write/mixed, sequential
  read/write/mixed);
- The IOPS limit per VM is set to 100 for random read/write/mixed test cases,
  and Rate limit per VM is set to 60MB/s for sequential read/write/mixed test
  cases;
- Block size is set to 4K for random read/write/mixed test cases, and 64K for
  sequential read/write/mixed test cases;
- IO Depth is set to 4 for random read/write/mixed test cases, and 64 for
  sequential read/write/mixed test cases;
- The stop limit for progression runs is degrading more than 20% of the target;

Note that it is hard to give a reference on storage testing since the
performance varies a lot on different hardware or solutions.

In order to perform a run using the default scale profile, set the max VM counts
for the test, enable progression run and leave everything else with their
default values.  KloudBuster will start the iteration until reaching the stop
limit or the max scale. Eventually, once the KloudBuster run is finished, the
cloud performance can be told by looking at how many VMs KloudBuster can run to
and by looking at the latency charts.


How-to
^^^^^^

In order to run KloudBuster Standard Scale Profile, you have to set up below
configurations:

1. Enable progression runs:

    Running from CLI: Edit the config file, and set
    **client:progression:enabled** to True

    Running from Web UI: Navigate to "Interactive Mode" from the top menu
    bar, unfold the left panel for detail settings, under "Progression Test"
    section, and check the "Progression Test" checkbox.

2. Set up the max scale:

    The max scale basically means the max VM counts that KloudBuster will try to
    reach. In the case of HTTP testing, for a typical 10GE NIC card with VLAN
    encapsulation, 25 will be a good value; in the case of Storage testing,
    depends on the solution the deployment is using, pick a number from 10 to 25
    would usually be fine. Remember you can always adjust it to a more
    reasonable value based on your deployment details.

    Running from CLI: Edit the config file, and set **server:vms_per_network**
    to a proper value.

    Running from Web UI: Navigate to "Interactive Mode" from the top menu
    bar, unfold the left panel for detail settings, under "Staging Settings"
    section, and set "VMs/Network" to a proper value.


Interpret the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the CLI, check the log and find the warning that KloudBuster gave, similar
to this::

    WARNING KloudBuster is stopping the iteration because the result reaches the stop limit.

One line before is the json output of last successful run, which has the number
in the "total_server_vms" field.

From the Web UI, in ihe "Interactive Mode" tab, you will see how many sets of
data are you getting. The second last set of data shows the last successful run,
which has the number in the "Server VMs" column.
