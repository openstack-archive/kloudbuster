=====================
KloudBuster version 7
=====================

How good is your OpenStack **data plane** or **storage service** under real
heavy load?

KloudBuster is a tool that can load the data plane or storage infrastructure of
any OpenStack cloud at massive scale and measure how well the cloud behaves
under load where it matters: from the VMs standpoint, where cloud applications
run.

Accessible to anybody with basic knowledge of OpenStack, installs in minutes
and runs off the box with sensible default workloads in a fully automated way.
CLI/REST or Web User Interface.. you pick what works best for you.


Feature List
------------

* Neutron configuration agnostic (any encapsulation, any overlay, any plugin)

* OpenStack Storage backend agnostic

* Real VM-level performance and scale numbers (not bare metal)

* Punishing scale (thousands of VMs and enough load to fill even the fastest NIC
  cards or load any storage cluster with ease)

* Data plane with HTTP traffic load:

   * Can load the data plane with one OpenStack cloud (single-cloud operations
     for L3 East-West scale) or 2 OpenStack clouds (dual-cloud operations with
     one cloud hosting the HTTP servers and the other loading HTTP traffic for
     L3 North-South scale testing)

   * Real HTTP servers (Nginx) running in real Linux images (Ubuntu 14.04)

   * Can specify any number of tenants, routers and networks

   * Can specify any number of HTTP servers per tenant (as many as your cloud
     can handle)

   * High performance and highly scalable HTTP traffic generators to simulate
     huge number of HTTP users and TCP connections (hundreds of thousands to
     millions of concurrent and active connections)

   * Overall throughput aggegation and loss-less millisecond-precision latency
     aggregation for every single HTTP request (typically millions per run)

   * Traffic shaping to specify on which links traffic should flow

   * Can support periodic reporting and aggregation of results

* Storage load:

   * VM-level Cinder volume (block storage) or Ephemeral disk file I/O
     performance measurement using FIO running inside VMs (not bare metal)

   * Supports random and sequential file access mode

   * Supports any mix of read/write

   * Supports fixed load (e.g. 1000 IOPs/VM) or highest load measurement
     (KloudBuster will increase the load until latency spikes)

   * IOPs, bandwitdh and loss-less millisecond-precision latency aggregation
     for every IO operation (typically millions per run)

   * User configurable workload sequence

   * Support for creating cinder volumes with custom volume types and associated QOS specs

* Supports automated scale progressions (VM count series in any multiple
  increment) to reduce dramatically scale testing time

* Highly efficient and scalable metric aggregation

* Automatic cleanup upon termination

* Regular expression based cleanup script (:ref:`cleanup`)

* KloudBuster server mode to drive scale test:

    * from any browser (KloudBuster Web UI)

    * or from any external programs (KloudBuster REST API)

* Aggregated results provide an easy to understand way to assess the scale of
  the cloud under test

* KloudBuster VM image pre-built and available from the OpenStack Community App
  Catalog (https://apps.openstack.org/)

**Diagrams** describing how the scale test resources are staged and how the
traffic flows are available in :ref:`arch`.

Scale results are available in json form or in html form with javascript
graphical charts generated straight off the tool.

**Examples of results** are available in :ref:`gallery`.

New in Release 7
----------------

* The KloudBuster Docker container now includes the KloudBuster VM image for easier
  setup (no more need to install/uplaod the VM image separately)

* Supports more recent OpenStack releases with newer API versions (Newton, Ocata)


Limitations and Non-Goals
-------------------------

* Requires Neutron networking (does not support Nova networking)

* Only supports HTTP and storage traffic in this version

Unlike some other scaling test frameworks, KloudBuster does **not** attempt to:

    * Provide a scale test framework that works across different cloud
      technologies (OpenStack + AWS + Google Cloud + ...) - we are only
      focusing on OpenStack

    * Provide a scale test framework that is flexible and programmable to do
      everything - we just focus on opinionated and well targeted performance
      and scale areas with sensible use cases and available in a fully
      integrated and easy to consume packaged format

    * Replace bare metal and domain specific native performance and scale
      frameworks (line level traffic generators, ceph specific performance and
      scale tools...)
